This is one of my first few personal projects! 

This hangman game is console-based in Java that incorporates word selection from a text file and/or interactive user input to account for both single and multiplayer game options. 
I have implemented game logic to track player guesses, display current word status, and manage win/loss conditions. 
Further, the game features an ASCII representation of the hangman, providing visual feedback for incorrect guesses. 
This prokect utilizes object-oriented programming principles to create a structured and modular design, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
